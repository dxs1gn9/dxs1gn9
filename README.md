# 👋 Hey, I’m Cleo Lazren (aka Cleoplasera)

I’m a 14-year-old indie dev from India building hardcore tools, from scratch, without funding or a full rig—yet.

## 🔧 Currently Building
- 🚀 **ClickToGrow** — an AI-powered micro-startup engine for SMBs in India  
- 🔐 **GoonerLocker** — a decentralized vault & identity toolkit (Termux-based)

## 🎯 Goals
- Ship my first open tools in 2025  
- Build with whatever I can find — or get  
- Inspire kids who build with zero

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Bash / Termux / Python / Shell scripting  
- Minimal Linux, no fluff. Just power.
